CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
Architecture

#Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The main use of Express HTMl was to render the server side as quickly as possible.  Javascript allowed for the page to become interactive both for the user and backend.  SPA was used in order to create a responsive and interactive interface for the user.  MongoDB schema allowed to easily adjust for new trips, and users.  It is capable of handling data at large volumes for both the administrative side and customer side.    

#Functionality
#How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Json is explained as a formatting language rather than a programming language.  It is easier for users to read and write.  It played in role in making sure data was correctly parsed through API requests.  Refactored code came when implementing instance of the html components.  Specifically for the add trip and edit trip compoenents.  This allowed for them to become reusable for one another based off the refactored coode.

#Testing
#Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Reflection
Methods such as GET/POST/PUT/DELETE are essentially CRUD where we can create read update and delete data for an application.  Endpoints, are specific URLs that an API uses for whichever functionality you are using it for.  Security is a major key to full stack developemnt when it comes to online applications.  This is where most things are vulnerable where people are consistently aiming to be malicious with amything on the web.  Being able to secure not only the adminsitrative information but also the customers/users information is very important in web applications.  


How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has helped guid me in the direction of where i need to continue practicing my coding on.  It has also helped me in choosing which programming languages to focus on.  A huge part of what Ive been missing my from my learnings throughout SNHU have been what it actually takes to build a Full Stack Web Application.  This is where I plan on focusing my professional career on mainly.  It has made me more aware of all the languages I need to continue learning as well as how they all interact with one another while also using apis, and security features.  Once Im trained and competent in this, my next goal is to become more proefficient with cyber security and protecting assets.
